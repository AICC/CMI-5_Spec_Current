# 1.0 Overview


This specification describes interoperable runtime communication between Learning Management Systems
(LMS) and Assignable Units (AU).

<a name="scope"></a>  
## 1.1 Scope

The scope of this specification is limited to the following:

* Launch by an LMS of AUs.
* Launch and runtime environment used by LMS and AUs.
* Runtime communication data and data transport between the LMS and AUs. 
* LMS course definition as it pertains to runtime data used by AUs.
* LMS Course Structure Import/Export.
* Reporting requirements for the LMS.

This specification references how to use the xAPI specification within this scope.

Other uses of the xAPI specification are outside of this scope.

Uses of activities not explicitly defined above are outside of the scope of this specification.

<a name="definitions"></a>   
# 3.0 Definitions  


For purposes of this specification, the following terms and definitions apply: 

* __Administrator__: The administrative user who manages the LMS and related systems. This user performs tasks such as learner enrollment, course structure definition, and report management.

* __Activity__: In this specification it is representative of an AU or the Object of a statement with objectType of “Activity”. Thus the granularity can be anything from a single AU course down to a specific interaction.

* __Assignable Unit (AU)__:  A learning content presentation launched from an LMS. The AU is the unit of tracking and management. The AU collects data on the learner and sends it to the LMS.

* __Block__: A grouping of AU's and other Blocks (nesting).

* __Course__: A collection of assignable units, in a logical grouping, of learning content. A course is typically an internal data structure. Courses are often assigned to learners and tracked by the LMS.

* __Course Structure__: A list of assignable units and launch parameters, with an implied sequence, representing a course.  

* __Experience API (xAPI)__: A runtime data communication specification for learning content (AU) to send and receive data to a Learning Record Store (LRS).  The xAPI specification referenced by this document is used to define the data transport and the data model.

* __Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)__: A unique identifier according to RFC 3987. The IRI may be an IRL. IRLs SHOULD be defined within a domain controlled by the person creating the IRL. Note that IRI’s in this spec MUST be fully qualified and not IRI References.

* __Internationalized Resource Locator (IRL)__: According to the xAPI specification, an IRL is an IRI that, when translated into a URI (according to the IRI to URI rules), is a URL.

* __Learner__: The end user viewing/using the learning content (AUs).

* __Learning Management System (LMS)__: A computer system that may include the capabilities to register learners, launch learning presentations, analyze and report learner performance, and track learners' progress. LMS launching, reporting, and tracking roles are the focus of the cmi5 specification. The LMS is integrated with an LRS. In the remainder of this document the term “LMS” refers to an integrated entity of LMS and LRS.

* __Learning Records Store (LRS)__: As defined in the xAPI specification.

* __Registration__: An enrollment instance of a learner in a course. (a registration ID uniquely identifies this). The registration ID persists throughout the course progress to completion and during review of a completed course. A new registration is created for new enrollment instances (such as recurrent courses or re-taking courses).

* __Session__: A period of time marked by the launch of an AU until its termination (or abandonment).

<a name="concept"></a> 
# 5.0 Conceptual Model: Informative  

Synopsis of the cmi5 model:
* An LMS imports a course structure which contains at least one AU.  Optionally, the course structure may include one or more blocks, which consist of 1 or more AUs or nested blocks.
* An LMS administrative user assigns a course to a learner.
* A learner authenticates with an LMS or a related system.
* A learner launches an AU from the LMS or an associated launching system, using an interface.
* The LMS writes launch data to the integrated LRS.
* The AU sends a message to the LMS requesting launch parameters and previous state information.
* The learner views the AU content and performs the learning. During this time, the AU MAY request data from, and store data to, the LMS.
* The learner exits the AU.
* The AU reports the final tracking data to the LMS and issues a "terminate" statement.
* Administrative users create and view reports of the tracking data recorded by the AUs for individual learners.

Responsibilities of the Assignable Unit:
* Parse the parameters from the launching environment to determine where the LMS location is and initiate communication with the LMS.
* Acting as a "client", send and receive messages using the defined transport mechanism(s) and associated commands as prescribed in this specification.
* Format all data according to the defined data types and vocabularies that are defined in this specification.
* Send a "terminate" statement prior to terminating the AU's execution.

Responsibilities of the LMS:
* Create and maintain course structures.
* Acting as a "server", receive and reply to messages using the defined transport mechanism(s) and associated commands as prescribed in this specification.
* Format all data according to the defined data types and vocabularies that are defined in this specification.
* Launch the specified AU contained in the courses within the defined environment(s).

<a name="lms_requirements"></a>

<a name="lms_statement_api_requirements"></a>  
## 6.3 LMS Statement API Requirements

The LMS MUST NOT provide permissions/credentials which allow the AU to issue voiding Statements.

The LMS SHOULD reject statements that conflict with the "Statement API" requirements as defined in Section 9.

The LMS MUST Void statements that are NOT rejected AND conflict with the "Statement API" requirements as defined in Section 9.

<a name="au_requirements"></a>  
# 7.0 AU Requirements

An AU MUST:

* Implement the runtime launch interface as defined in Section 8.
* Implement runtime communication as defined in the xAPI Specification.
* Implement State API requirements in this specification as defined in Section 10.
* Implement Profile API requirements in this specification as defined in Section 11.
* Implement Statement API requirements as defined in Section 7.1.

<a name="au_statement_api_requirements"></a>  
## 7.1 AU Statement API Requirements

<a name="first_statement_au"></a> 
### 7.1.1 First Statement API Call
The AU MUST issue a statement to the LRS after being launched, initialized, and ready for learner interaction using the Initialized verb as described in Section 9.3.2.

<a name="last_statement_au"></a>  
### 7.1.2 Last Statement Call
The AU MUST issue a Terminated statement to the LRS as described in Section 9.3.8 as the last statement in a session.
 
Once the AU has determined that the session will end (e.g. by user action or some other means) the AU SHOULD issue a Terminated statement.
 
 Circumstances under which the AU may determine that the session is ending could include:
 
* Monitoring for browser window or application close events
* An AU defined user action for closing the AU session
* Other AU defined events such as a timeout from user inactivity


<a name="type_statement_au"></a>  
### 7.1.3 Types of Statements
The statements issued within an AU session could fall within the following categories:

* "cmi5 defined" - Statements using cmi5 defined verbs, category id as defined in section 9.6.2.1, and context template.
* "cmi5 allowed" - Statements using any verb and cmi5 context template (but NOT including cmi5 category id as defined in section 9.6.2.1).
* "cmi5 not-allowed" - Any statements not conforming with the cmi5 specification.

"cmi5 allowed" statements posted by the AU MUST occur between cmi5 statements using the "Initialized" verb and the "Terminated" verb. "cmi5 allowed" statements are not considered in cmi5 defined session management and completion rules.

<a name="content_launch"></a>  
# 8.0 Content Launch Mechanisms

<a name="launch_method"></a>  
## 8.1 Launch Method

The AU MUST be launched by the LMS using one of the following methods, depending on the launchMethod in the Course Structure (Section 13.1.4 AU Meta Data, URL):

When the launchMethod is "OwnWindow", the LMS MUST use one of the following:
* Spawning a new browser window for the AU.
* Re-directing the existing browser window to the AU.

When the launchMethod is "AnyWindow", the LMS MUST choose the window context of the AU.  All browser window options are acceptable - Frameset, New window, browser redirect, etc.

Regardless of the launchMethod the AU MUST be launched by the LMS with a URL having query string launch parameters as defined in this section. The launch parameters MUST be name/value pairs in a query string appended to the URL that launches the AU.

If the AU's URL requires a query string for other purposes, then the names MUST NOT collide with named parameters defined below.

The AU MUST have the ability to process the query string launch parameters in any order.

Each value for the associated names MUST be URL-encoded. 

The format of the launching URL is as follows:  

```
<URL to AU>
?endpoint=<URL to LMS Listener>
&fetch=<Fetch URL for the Authorization Token>
&actor=<Actor>
&registration=<Registration ID>
&activityId=<AU activity ID>
```

Example:

```
http://www.example.com/LA1/Start.html
?endpoint=http://lrs.example.com/lrslistener/
&fetch=http://lms.example.com/tokenGen.htm?k=2390289x0
&actor={"objectType": "Agent","account": 
{"homePage": "http://www.example.com","name": "1625378"}}
&registration=760e3480-ba55-4991-94b0-01820dbd23a2
&activityId=http://www.example.com/LA1/001/intro
```

(For readability the above example is not URL encoded.)

The values for the URL launch parameters are described below:

## 8.2 Authorization Token Fetch URL

<a name="fetch_url_overview"></a>
### 8.2.1 Overview
The LMS MUST include the <strong><em>fetch</em></strong> name/value pair in the launch URL.  The AU MUST make an HTTP POST to the <strong><em>fetch</em></strong> URL to retrieve an authorization token.  Note than an HTTP GET is not allowed in order to prevent caching of the request.

The <strong><em>fetch</em></strong> URL MUST return a JSON structure using a Content-Type of "application/json". An example JSON structure is shown below:
```javascript
{
  "auth-token": "QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ=="
}
```
The AU MUST place the <strong><em>auth-token</em></strong> in the HTTP header, as defined in <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#section-11'>RFC 1945 - 11.1 Basic Authentication Scheme</a>, in all subsequent xAPI communications with the LMS.  The authorization token returned by the <strong><em>fetch</em></strong> URL MUST be limited to the duration of the session.

The AU SHOULD NOT attempt to retrieve the authorization token more than once.  The <strong><em>fetch</em></strong> URL is a "one-time use" URL and subsequent uses SHOULD generate an error (see Section 8.2.3).

### 8.2.3 Errors

<a name="duplicate_call_to_fetch_url"></a>  
#### 8.2.3.1 Duplicate call to fetch URL
The <strong><em>fetch</em></strong> URL is a "one-time use" URL and only the first request SHOULD return the <strong><em>auth-token</em></strong>. Subsequent requests made to the <strong><em>fetch</em></strong> URL during the session SHOULD generate an error.  The error SHOULD be returned in the form of a JSON structure using Content-Type "application/json".  An example JSON structure is shown below:
```javascript
{
  "error-code": "1",
  "error-text": "The authorization token has already been returned."
}
```
<a name="fetch_url_error_values"></a>
#### 8.2.3.2 Error Values
The following <strong><em>error-code</em></strong> values are allowed.
<table>
<tr><td><strong>Code</strong></td><td><strong>Meaning</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Already in Use or Expired</strong> - Token has been used before or the AU session has expired</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>General Security Error</strong> - All other security issues including invalid tokens</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>General Application Error</strong> - Application or environment failures</td></tr>
</table>

The values for <strong><em>error-text</em></strong> are defined by the LMS.

<a name="other_environment"></a>  
## 8.3 Other Launch Environments

Other launch environments are not currently implemented in this specification. cmi5 implementations for LMS's and AU's in these other environments will use the same REST communication interface as specified in xAPI specification.  The xAPI specification does not specify launch mechanisms.

<a name="xapi_data_model"></a>  
# 9.0 xAPI Statement Data Model  

<a name="statement_id" ></a>
## 9.1 Statement ID
The AU MUST assign a statement id property in UUID format (as defined in the xAPI specification) for all statements it issues.
  
<a name="actor" ></a>
## 9.2 Actor
The Actor property will be defined by the LMS. The Actor property for all "cmi5 defined" statements MUST be of objectType "Agent". The Actor property MUST contain an "account" IFI as defined in the xAPI specification.

<a name="verbs" ></a> 
## 9.3 Verbs  

The following xAPI verbs are defined in this specification.

Note that "cmi5 allowed" statements are NOT subject to the usage rules in this section. 

All statements in this section refer to "cmi5 defined" statements unless otherwise noted.

AUs MUST use the below verbs that are indicated as mandatory in other sections of this specification.

For all requirements listed below including language involving order, the order is determined by the value of the timestamp property.

AU Verb Ordering Rules within an AU session are as follows:
* Verbs MUST NOT be duplicated (in cmi5 defined statements).
* More than one of the set of {"Passed","Failed"} verbs MUST NOT be used (in cmi5 defined statements).
* The "Initialized" verb MUST be the first statement (cmi5 allowed or defined).
* The "Terminated" verb MUST be the last statement (cmi5 allowed or defined).

AU Verb Ordering Rules within a Registration (per AU) are as follows:
* Exactly zero or one "Completed" cmi5 defined statement MUST be used per registration.
* Exactly zero or one "Passed" cmi5 defined statement MUST be used per registration.
* A "Failed" statement MUST NOT follow a "Passed" statement (in cmi5 defined statements) per registration.

AUs may use additional verbs not listed in this specification.

The LMS MUST record and provide reporting for all statements regardless of the verbs used in statements sent by AUs. 

LMS verb ordering rules are as follows:
* LMS may issue multiple satisfied statements (in a session).
* LMS SHOULD NOT issue multiple satisfied statements (in a registration).
* LMS MUST NOT issue more than one abandoned statement for a session.
* LMS MUST NOT issue more than one waived statement per session and MUST not issue more than one waived statement per registration per AU.

Other cmi5 defined statements MUST NOT include the "completion" property.

<a name="duration"></a>
### 9.5.4 Duration
The "duration" property is an ISO 8601 formatted time value required in certain statements as defined in this section. Other cmi5 defined statements MAY include the duration property.
<a name="au_statements_that_include_duration"></a>
#### 9.5.4.1 AU statements that include duration
##### Terminated Statement
The AU MUST include the "duration" property in "Terminated" statements.  The AU SHOULD calculate duration for Terminated statements as the time difference between the "Initialized" statement and the "Terminated" statement.  The AU may use other methods to calculate the duration based on criteria determined by the AU.
##### Completed Statement
The AU MUST include the "duration" property in "Completed" statements.  The AU SHOULD calculate duration as the time spent by the learner to achieve completion status.
##### Passed Statement
The AU MUST include the "duration" property in "Passed" statements.  The AU SHOULD calculate duration as the time spent by the learner to attempt and succeed in a judged activity of the AU. 
##### Failed Statement
The AU MUST include the "duration" property in "Failed" statements. The AU SHOULD calculate duration as the time spent by the learner to attempt and fail in a judged activity of the AU.

<a name="lms_statements_that_include_duration"></a>
#### 9.5.4.2 LMS statements that include duration
##### Abandoned Statement
The duration property MUST be included in "Abandoned" statements. The LMS SHOULD use LMS specific methods (if available) to determine the duration if it has more accurate means of session time calculation than time stamp differences between statements. In the absence of such methods, the duration property MUST be set as the total session time, calculated as the time between the "Launched" statement and the last statement (of any kind) issued by the AU.

<a name="context"></a> 
## 9.6 Context

All cmi5 defined statements MUST contain a context that includes all properties as defined in this section. Either the LMS or the AU MAY provide additional properties.

<a name="registration"></a> 
### 9.6.1 registration
The value for the registration property used in the context object MUST be the value provided by the LMS. The LMS MUST generate this value and pass it to the AU via the launch URL.  The LMS MUST evaluate MoveOn criteria in the course structure at the time of registration.  For example, AUs with MoveOn criteria of "Not Applicable" in the course structure would be evaluated and could generate Satisfied statements at this time.

For all Satisfied statements triggered outside of an AU launch session, the LMS MUST generate a unique session id and use it for those statements.

<a name="context_activities"></a>
### 9.6.2 contextActivities
The purpose of this property is to facilitate searches of the LRS by the LMS or other reporting systems. The "contextActivities" property contains list(s) of Activity objects whose ids can be used as a statement list filter.  All cmi5 defined statements MUST include all properties and values defined in the contextActivites of the context template (see section 10 - xAPI State Data Model).

<a name="context_activities_category_cmi5"></a>
#### 9.6.2.1 cmi5 Category Activity
An Activity object with an "id" of "https://w3id.org/xapi/cmi5/context/categories/cmi5" in the "category" context activities list MUST be used in cmi5 defined statements as described in section 7.1.3.

<a name="context_activities_category_moveon"></a>
#### 9.6.2.2 moveOn Category Activity
cmi5 defined statements with a Result object (Section 9.5) that include either "success" or "completion" properties MUST have an Activity object with an "id" of "https://w3id.org/xapi/cmi5/context/categories/moveon" in the "category" context activities list. Other statements MUST NOT include this Activity.

<a name="context_activities_grouping_publisherid"></a>
#### 9.6.2.3 Publisher ID Grouping Activity
Used to identify statements about the AU using the publisher's id from the course structure.

The LMS MUST include an Activity object with an "id" property whose value is the unaltered value of the AU's "id" attribute from the course structure (See Section 13.1.4 AU Metadata – id) in the "grouping" context activities list in the "contextTemplate" as described in the State API (See Section 10) prior to launching an AU. The LMS MUST include the publisher id Activity in the "grouping" context activities list for all "cmi5 defined" and "cmi5 allowed" statements it makes directly in the LRS.

<a name="extensions"></a>
### 9.6.3 extensions
The following are extensions specified for cmi5.  Other extensions are permitted provided they do not conflict or duplicate the ones specified here.

All statements MUST include a timestamp property per the xAPI specification to ensure statement ordering requirements are met. All timestamps MUST be recorded in UTC time. Timestamps are not required to be unique in statements within a session. The time recorded SHOULD indicate when the condition actually occurred.


<a name="xapi_state"></a>  
# 10.0 xAPI State Data Model

Prior to launching an AU, the LMS MUST create or update a document in the State API record in the LRS.  This MUST be a JSON document, as defined in this section.

__State API PUT Properties__:

* _activityId_: Activity id for the AU
* _agent_: Agent representing the LMS learner being enrolled.  This MUST match the actor property generated by LMS at AU launch time.
* _registration_: Registration id representing the LMS learner enrollment in the course. This MUST match Registration ID used by the LMS at AU launch time.

<a name="xapi_agent_profile"></a>   
# 11.0 xAPI Agent Profile Data Model  

In cmi5, Learner Preferences are scoped to the learner.  Both the LMS and the AU MAY write changes to Learner Preferences in the xAPI Agent Profile.  The LMS/LRS MAY choose to ignore or override Learner Preference changes requested by the AU by returning a "403 Forbidden" response as defined in the xAPI specification (Section 7.6).  The AU MUST NOT treat the 403 response as an error condition.

On startup, the AU MUST retrieve the Learner Preferences document from the Agent Profile.

When reading or writing to the Agent Profile, the document name MUST be "cmi5LearnerPreferences" and the format MUST be a JSON structure as shown below:

```javascript
{
  "languagePreference": "<values for languages>",
  "audioPreference": "<on or off>"
}
```
<a name="language_preference"></a>
## 11.1  languagePreference
The languagePreference MUST be a comma-separated list of RFC 5646 Language Tags as indicated in the xAPI specification (Section 5.2).  In the list, languages MUST be specified in order of user preference.  In the example below, the user's first preference for language is en-US.  The user's second preference for language is fr-FR and the third preference is fr-BE.

```javascript
{
  "languagePreference": "en-US,fr-FR,fr-BE",
  ...
}
```

If the AU supports multiple languages, the AU SHOULD display in the language preference order of the user as in the example above. If the AU supported "zh-CN", "fr-BE" and "fr-FR", it SHOULD display in "fr-FR".  If the AU does not support multiple languages, or if no languagePreference is specified in the Agent Profile, it may display in its default language.

<a name="audio_preference"></a>

## 11.2 audioPreference
The audioPrefence value indicates whether the audio SHOULD be "on" or "off".  The AU MUST turn the audio on or off at startup based on this value.  If no value is provided in the Agent Profile for audioPreference the AU MAY use its own default value.

Example:
```javascript
{
  "audioPreference": "on",
  ...
}
```


<a name="xapi_activity_profile"></a>  
# 12.0 xAPI Activity Profile Data Model

The AU MAY use the Activity Profile API according to the xAPI specification (Section 7.5 - Activity Profile API).


<a name="course_requirements"></a>

# 13.0 Course Structure Data Requirements  

<a name="course_structure_data_model"></a>
## 13.1 Course Structure Data Model
All leading/trailing whitespace MUST be removed by the LMS on import of the course structure for all of the data elements defined in this section.

The following Data Types are used in the cmi5 course structure data model, see the cmi5.xsd (section 13.2) for specific format:
   * **decimal** – XSD definition:  "xs:decimal"
   * **IRI** – XSD definition:  "xs:anyURI"
   * **string** –  XSD definition: "xs:string"
   * **langstring** – XSD definition : <xs:element name="langstring" maxOccurs="unbounded" minOccurs="1"/>
   * **objectiveReference** – XSD definition : <xs:element name="objectives" type="referencesObjectivesType" minOccurs="0"/>

### 13.1.5 Vendor Specific Metadata (Extensions)

Course Designers MAY place their own namespaced elements into the course structure and thus define an extension for the source structure specification. For that they MUST provide a XML Schema Definition and SHOULD provide a human readable specification describing these vendor specific extensions. These extensions MUST keep the course structure XML valid. An importing LMS MAY ignore these elements. Therefore the extension SHOULD be created in such a manner that a course is still useable if the LMS does not support the additional elements.

To achieve a larger distribution of their extension course designers SHOULD choose a free or open source license for their specification and make it publicly available.

<a name="course_structure_xsd"></a>  
## 13.2 Course Structure XSD 

Available locally in [v1/CourseStructure.xsd](v1/CourseStructure.xsd) or remotely at https://w3id.org/xapi/profiles/cmi5/v1/CourseStructure.xsd.
All course structures created for LMS import functionality and created by the LMS for export MUST conform to this XSD and be named "cmi5.xml".

<a name="course_package"></a>
# 14.0 Course Package
For the course import and export defined in Section 6.1, the LMS MUST support all of the following formats:
<ul><li>Zip32</li>
<li>Zip64</li>
<li>A course structure XML file</li>
</ul>

<a name="course_packages_in_zip_format"></a>
## 14.1 Course Packages in ZIP Format
The two ZIP file formats MUST follow the specification defined at https://www.pkware.com/support/zip-app-note.  When the ZIP file is used to package a course, it MUST contain the course structure XML file at its root directory and it MAY contain media associated with the course AUs.

<ul><li>Any media included in a ZIP course package MUST use relative URL references in the Course Structure XML.</li>
<li>Any media not included in a ZIP course package MUST use fully qualified URL references in the Course Structure XML.</li>
<li>A ZIP course package MAY contain a mix of fully qualified and relative URLs, provided the rules above are followed.</li>
</ul>

<a name="course_structure_xml_without_a_zip_file_package"></a>
## 14.2 Course Structure XML Without a ZIP File Package
When a course structure XML file is provided without a ZIP file package, all URL references MUST be fully qualified.

<a name="course_structure_examples"></a> 
# 15.0 Course Structure Examples

Using the domain of geology the following two examples demonstrate how simple and complex a course designer can structure a course. The titles and descriptions are fetched or translated from the Earth Sciences Portal at Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Earth_sciences).

<a name="course_structure_examples_simple"></a> 
## 15.1 Simple

Simple single AU course structure is available in [v1/examples/simple-cmi5.xml](v1/examples/simple-cmi5.xml).

<a name="course_structure_examples_complex"></a> 
## 15.2 Complex

Complex course structure with multiple objectives, multiple blocks with nesting, multiple AU blocks, etc. is available in  [v1/examples/complex-cmi5.xml](v1/examples/complex-cmi5.xml).

<a name="course_structure_examples_extension"></a> 
# 15.3 Extension

An extended simple course structure example is available in [v1/examples/extended-cmi5.xml](v1/examples/extended-cmi5.xml) which uses vendor specific metadata following the XML Schema Definition defined in [v1/examples/extended-cmi5.xsd](v1/examples/extended-cmi5.xsd).

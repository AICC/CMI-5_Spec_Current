### What is cmi5? A set of "extra rules" for xAPI

<table style="border: 0px;">
<tr width="50%">
  <td>
cmi5 is a "profile" for using the [xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec) with traditional learning management (LMS) systems.
<br><br>
Since the xAPI specification is highly generalized to support many different use cases, a set of "extra rules" (called a "profile") is needed to ensure interoperability for a given use case. The cmi5 profile ensures plug and play interoperability between learning content and LMS systems.
<br><br>
The use case that the cmi5 profile is specifically designed for is one where the learner launches the learning content/activity from the LMS user interface.
<br><br>
cmi5 defines specific interoperability rules for the following areas:
<br><br>
- Content Launch Mechanism
- Authentication
- Session Management
- Reporting
- Course Structure</td>

### What is cmi5? A set of "extra rules" for xAPI

<table style="border: 0px;">
<tr>
  <td>
cmi5 is a "profile" for using the [xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec) with traditional learning management (LMS) systems.
<br><br>
Since the xAPI specification is highly generalized to support many different use cases, a set of "extra rules" (called a "profile") is needed to ensure interoperability for a given use case. The cmi5 profile ensures plug and play interoperability between learning content and LMS systems.
<br><br>
The use case that the cmi5 profile is specifically designed for is one where the learner launches the learning content/activity from the LMS user interface.
<br><br>
cmi5 defines specific interoperability rules for the following areas:
<br><br>  
    
<ul>
<li>Content Launch Mechanism</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Session Management</li>
<li>Reporting</li>
<li>Course Structure</li>  
</ul>

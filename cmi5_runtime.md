#1.0 Overview


This specification describes interoperable runtime communication between Learning
Management Systems (LMS) and Learning Activities.

<a id="scope"/>  
##1.1 Scope

The scope of this specification is limited to following:

* Launch by a Learning Management Systems (LMS) of Learning Activities.
* Launch and Runtime environment used for LMS and Learning Activities.
* Runtime communication data and data transport between LMS systems and Learning Activities 
* LMS course definition as it pertains to runtime data used by Learning Activities.  
* Reporting Requirements for LMS systems

This specification references how to use the XAPI specification within this scope.

Other uses of the XAPI specification are outside the scope.

Uses of Learning Activities and LMS systems not explicitly defined in this specification
are outside of the scope of this specification.


<a id="references"/>  
#2.0  References

The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this
specification. 

RFC 2396, “Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax,” August 1998.

“Experience API”, curent working draft, ADL, 2012-2013  
<https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md>

<a id="definitions"/>   
#3.0 Definitions  


For purposes of this specification, the following terms and definitions apply: 

* __Administrator__: The administrative user that manages the LMS and related systems.
Such a user performs tasks such as learner enrollment, course structure definition, and
report management. 

* __Assignable Unit (AU)__:  A learning presentation launched from an
LMS. The AU is the unit of tracking and management. The AU collects data on the learner
and sends it to the LMS system. An Learning Activity Provider maps to a single AU.  

* __Course__: A collection of assignable units, in a logical grouping. A course is typically 
an internal data structure. Courses are often assigned to learners and tracked by the LMS.

* __Course Structure__: A list of assignable units and launch parameters, with an implied
sequence, representing a course. Experience API (XAPI): XAPI is a runtime data
communication specification for learning content (AU) to send and receive data to an LRS.
The XAPI specification is referenced by this document is used to define the data transport
and the data model. 

* __Learner__: The end user viewing/using the learning content (Learning Activity).

* __Learning Activity Provider (AP)__:  Learning Activity Provider (AP) as defined in the
XAPI specification.

* __Learning Management System (LMS)__: A computer system that may include the
capabilities to register learners, launch learning presentations, analyze and report
learner performance, and track learners progress. LMS launching, reporting, and tracking
roles are the focus of the CMI5 specification.  The LMS shall have an LRS as part of its
implementation.

* __Learning Records Store (LRS)__: As defined in the XAPI specification. In this 
specification, the LMS shall implement an LRS with additional requirements as specified in
this document.

#4.0  Conformance

Conformance to this specification is defined in section. 

In this specification, “shall” is to be interpreted as a requirement on an implementation;
“shall not” is to be interpreted as a prohibition.

“Should” is to be interpreted as a recommendation for implementation; “should not” is to
be interpreted as the converse of “should”.

“May” is to be interpreted as a course of action that is permissible within the limits of
the specification; “need not” indicates a course of action that is not required.

Uses of XAPI specification outside the scope this specification do not affect conformance
with this specification.

<a id="concept"/>  
#5.0 Conceptual Model: Informative  

Synopsis of the CMI-5 model:

* An LMS imports a course structure.
* An LMS administrative user assigns a course to a learner.
* A learner authenticates with an LMS or related system.
* A learner launches an Assignable Unit (learning content) from the LMS or associated
launching system.
* The learning activity sends a message to the LMS requesting launch parameters and recovers
previous state information from the LRS.
* Learner views the learning activity content and performs the learning. During this time
the learning activity may request and store data.
* The learner exits the learning activity.
* The learning activity reports final tracking data to the LMS and issues an exit message.
* Administrative users create and view reports of tracking data recorded by learning
activities for individual learners.

Responsibilities of the Assignable Unit:

* Parse the parameters from the launching environment to determine where the LMS location
is and initiate communication with the LMS.
* Acting as “client”, send and receive messages using the defined transport mechanism(s)
and associate commands as prescribed in this specification.
* Format all data per defined data types and vocabularies defined in this specification.
* Send an “exit” message prior to terminating the learning activity’s execution.

Responsibilities of the LMS:

* Create and maintain course structures
* Acting as a “server”, receive and reply to messages using the defined transport
mechanism(s) and associate commands as prescribed in this specification.
* Format all data per defined data types and vocabularies defined in this specification.
* Launch the specified learning activity contained in courses, in the defined environment(s).

#8.0 Content Launch Mechanisms

<a id="browser_environment"/>  
##8.1 Web (Browser) Environment

###8.1.1 Launch Method

The AU shall be launched by the LMS by one of the following methods:

1. Spawning a new browser window to the URL  
2. Re-directing the existing browser window (or section of the existing window) to the URL  

The Launch method used by the LMS shall be determined by the “Launch Method” defined in
the LMS’s course structure for the AU being launched. (See ______) URL Launch Line

The AU shall be launched by the LMS with a URL having (query string) launch parameters as
defined in this section.

The launch parameters shall be name/value pairs in a query string appended to the URL that
launches the learning activity.

If the learning activity’s URL requires a query string for other purposes, then the names
shall not collide with named parameters defined below.

The order of the name/value pairs is not significant. AU’s shall have the ability to
process them in any order.

Each value for the associated names shall be URL-encoded. 

The format of the launching URL is as follows:  

```
<URL to AU>
?endpoint=<URL to LMS Listener>
&auth=<Authorization Token (optional)– if OAuth is not used>
&actor=<Actor Object>
&registration=<Registration ID>
&activity_id=<AU activity ID>
&session_id=<LMS defined Session ID>
```

Example:

```
http://la.cmi5.aicc.org/LA1/Start.html
?endpoint=http://cmi-5-lms-system.org/lrslistner/
&auth=OjFjMGY4NTYxNzUwOGI4YWY0NjFkNzU5MWUxMzE1ZGQ1
&actor={ "name" : ["Skip Winger"], "mbox" : ["mailto:skipper@skyhiair.com"] }

## Goals

The mission of cmi5 is to provide a better alternative to current AICC/SCORM specifications with something considerably more flexible, robust, and adaptable to today's technologies. The specific goals of cmi5 are as follows:

#### 1 - A simplified tracking data model

SCORM and AICC data models were too complicated and had many optional data elements that were not used. The goal of simple data model is to only define the bare minimum data elements required that would work across most learning domains. (e.g. Score, status, and time).

#### 2 - The ability to record and report/retrieve content-defined data

Restricting data collection to a small set of required data elements was too limiting.  In most cases what was really needed was the just the ability to record the data from the content in the LMS and later retrieve it for analysis. The goal of allowing content defined data recording/retrieval allows content designers to add features and still be interoperable.

Content defined data can either be text or digital data.

- Extensible Data Model (defined by the content text data)
- Digital Data attachments

#### 3 - Support for content as a service (CaaS) model of delivery
Allow content to be stored on other domains (independent of the LMS server domain)

#### 4 - Device/OS/browser independence

Allow for content to be independent of a browser in order to communicate or be launched.

#### 5 - Share data between learning activities

Allow data to be shared between learning activities for multiple learners enrolled in the same course.

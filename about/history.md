## History

The ***cmi5*** project was originally started in the AICC (Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee) in 2010. ***cmi5*** was expected to replace both AICC and SCORM specifications with a more feature-rich and robust solution.  Both AICC and SCORM specifications had technical issues and constraints as well as significant overlap.

The AICC was nearing completion of SOAP-based communication mechanism for cmi5 in 2012 about the same time the Tin Can API research project (now called xAPI) was completed in the ADL.

The AICC and ADL participants soon determined that there was significant overlap between the two specifications.  xAPI had broader application than ***cmi5***, so the ADL and AICC agreed to cooperate on an "xAPI profile" to meet the more specific use case needs of ***cmi5***. So the cmi5 project was "rebooted" in 2012 and the SOAP architecture was replaced with xAPI. The ***cmi5*** project is still guided by its original goals.

In 2014, the AICC  dissolved and formally transferred the ***cmi5*** project to the ADL.

# 1.0 Overview


This specification describes the course structure interchange format for Learning Management Systems (LMS).  

<a name="scope"/> 
## 1.1 Scope

The scope of this specification is limited to following:
* LMS Course Structure Import/Export
* LMS course definition as it pertains to runtime data used by Learning Activities.  


<a name="references"/> 
# 2.0  References

The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this specification. 

RFC 2396, “Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax,” August 1998.<br/>

“Experience API”, current specification, ADL, 2012-2013<br/>
https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md

CMI5-001  – CMI-5 Runtime Environment, Version x.x, AICC, TBD  




<a name="definitions"/>  
# 3.0 Definitions  


For purposes of this specification, the following terms and definitions apply: 

* __Administrator__: The administrative user that manages the LMS and related systems. Such a user performs tasks such as learner enrollment, course structure definition, and report management.

* __Course__: A collection of assignable units, in a logical grouping, of learning content. A course is typically an internal data structure. Courses are often assigned to learners and tracked by the LMS.

* __Course Structure__: A list of assignable units and launch parameters, with an implied sequence, representing a course.  

* __Experience API (XAPI)__: XAPI is a runtime data communication specification for learning content (AU) to send and receive data to an LRS.  The XAPI specification is referenced by this document is used to define the data transport and the data model. 

* __Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)__: A unique identifier per RFC 3987.  The IRI may be an IRL. All IRIs should be a full absolute IRIs including a scheme. Relative IRIs should not be used. IRLs should be defined within a domain controlled by the person creating the IRL.

* __Internationalized Resource Locator (IRL)__: Per the xAPI specification, an IRL is an IRI that when translated into a URI (per the IRI to URI rules), is a URL. Some communities of practice simply use URL even if they use IRIs, which isn't as technically correct within xAPI.

* __Learner__: The end user viewing/using the learning content (Learning Activity).

* __Assignable Unit (AU)__:  A learning content presentation launched from an LMS. The AU is the unit of tracking and management. The AU collects data on the learner and sends it to the LMS system.

* __Learning Management System (LMS)__: A computer system that may include the capabilities to register learners, launch learning presentations, analyze and report learner performance, and track learners progress. LMS launching, reporting, and tracking roles are the focus of the CMI5 specification.  The LMS must have an LRS as part of its implementation.

* __Learning Records Store (LRS)__: As defined in the XAPI specification.  In this specification, the LMS must implement an LRS with additional requirements as specified in this document.

* __Must / Should / May__: Three levels of obligation with regards to conformance to the CMI-5 specification. A system that fails to implement a MUST (or a MUST NOT) requirement is non-conformant. Failing to meet a SHOULD requirement is not a violation of conformity, but goes against best practices. MAY indicates an option, to be decided by the developer with no consequences for conformity.

__ADL__: Advanced Distributed Learning  
__AICC__: Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee  
__API__: Application Programming Interface  
__CMI__: Computer Managed Instruction  
__LMS__: Learning Management System  
__LRS__: Learning Record Store  
__PII__: Personally Identifiable Information

<a name="conformance"/>
# 4.0  Conformance

Conformance to this specification is defined in section. 

In this specification, “must” is to be interpreted as a requirement on an implementation; “must not” is to be interpreted as a prohibition.  
“Should” is to be interpreted as a recommendation for implementation; “should not” is to be interpreted as the converse of “should”.  
“May” is to be interpreted as a course of action that is permissible within the limits of the specification; “need not” indicates a course of action that is not required.
Uses of XAPI specification outside the scope this specification do not affect conformance with this specification.

<a name="au_conformance"/>
## 4.1 Courses

A course must be bundled with a course structure data that conform to all requirements listed in Section 7  
Course structure data must not implement any features or functionality (optional or mandatory) described in this specification in a non-conforming manner.  


<a name="lms_conformance"/>
## 4.2 Learning Management Systems (LMS)

LMS systems must conform to all requirements listed in Section 6 – LMS Requirements.  
The LMS must not implement any features or functionality (optional or mandatory) described in this specification in a non-conforming manner.  

<a name="concept"/>
# 5.0 Conceptual Model: Informative  

Synopsis of the CMI-5 model:
* An LMS imports a course structure.
* An LMS administrative user assigns a course to a learner.
* A learner authenticates with an LMS or related system.
* A learner launches an Assignable Unit (learning content) from the LMS or associated launching system, using an interface.
* The learning activity (AU) sends a message to the LMS requesting launch parameters and previous state information.
* Learner views the learning activity content and performs the learning. During this time the learning activity may request data from and store data to the LMS.
* The learner exits the learning activity.
* The learning activity reports final tracking data to the LMS and issues an exit message.
* Administrative users create and view reports of tracking data recorded by learning activities for individual learners.

Responsibilities of the Assignable Unit:
* Parse the parameters from the launching environment to determine where the LMS location is and initiate communication with the LMS.
* Acting as “client”, send and receive messages using the defined transport mechanism(s) and associated commands as prescribed in this specification.
* Format all data per defined data types and vocabularies defined in this specification.
* Send an “exit” message prior to terminating the learning activity’s execution.

Responsibilities of the LMS:
* Create and maintain course structures.
* Acting as a “server”, receive and reply to messages using the defined transport mechanism(s) and associated commands as prescribed in this specification.
* Format all data per defined data types and vocabularies defined in this specification.
* Launch the specified learning activity contained in courses, in the defined environment(s).

<a name="lms_requirements"/>
# 6.0 LMS Requirements

LMS systems must meet the following requirements to conform to this specification:  

1. The LMS must implement a means to import course structures as defined in section 6.1
2. The LMS must implement a means to export course structures as defined in section 6.1

<a name="course_structures"/>
## 6.1 Course structure requirements

1.	The LMS must implement the import of the course data structure defined in section 7. <br/>
2.	The LMS must implement the export of the course data structure defined in section 7. <br/>
3.	The LMS should provide a user interface to LMS administrative users to create and edit course structures internally.<br/>
4.	The LMS must be able support course structures with one or more AU’s.
